This is a small but important portion of my work during my research at University of Turku. 

I worked mostly with Texas Instrument’s C6711 (Floating point) and C5510 (Fixed­point) DSP processors using their respective development kits. Mostly I utilized MATLAB and development kit to experiment and perform different operations. Unfortunately, the CD got destroyed and I no longer have those projects anymore.
