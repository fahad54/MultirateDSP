Multirate processing and sampling rate conversion are clever digital signal processing techniques that can be employed
during the system design process. Using these techniques, one can gain an added degree of freedom that could improve 
the overall performance of system architecture. The most immediate reason is when you pass data between two systems 
which use incompatible sampling rates. For example, professional audio systems use a rate of 48 kHz, but consumer 
CD players use a rate of 44.1 kHz. When audio professionals transfer their recorded music to CDs, they need to do a 
rate conversion. 

But the most common reason is that multirate DSP can greatly increase processing efficiency,
which reduces DSP system cost. In telecommunication systems that transmit and receive various signals 
(audio, video, etc.), the sampling rate of the system has to be adjusted to suit the bandwidth of the signal in 
order to avoid signal degradation such as aliasing and imaging.

A fascinating example of a multirate system is the “tri-band” cellular phone, which can be used over an analog and 
two digital systems. When the phone “switches” its mode, the sampling rate is also changed in order to accommodate 
the different modulation scheme. At other times multirate processing is used to reduce computational overhead of
a system. For example, if an algorithm requires k operations per cycle, then by reducing the sampling rate of a 
signal or system by a factor of D, the arithmetic bandwidth requirements are reduced from kf s operations to kfs/D 
operations per second. 

This application provide a glimpse of how applications are using multirate processing and sampling rate conversion.
